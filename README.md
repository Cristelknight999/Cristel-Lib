## Using Cristel Lib with data
First create the folder where you will put your files for cristellib.
- For modpack makers, it'll be in the instance folder, in `config/cristellib/data`.
- For modders, it'll be `/data/YOURMODID`.

### Creating a structure config
In your folder you'll have to make another called `structure_configs`. In this folder you will create files which will add configs for the structures you want.
To create a config create a new json file the name of the file will be the name of the config file later.
